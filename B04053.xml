            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>SIR, Though your grace hath put great Order.</l>
               <l>Both in the Highlands and the Border.</l>
               <l>Yet I make ſupplication.</l>
               <l>To have ſome reformation,</l>
               <l>Of a ſmall Fault, which is no Treaſon,</l>
               <l>Though it be contrary to Reaſon,</l>
               <l>Becauſe the Matter been ſo vile,</l>
               <l>It may not have an ornat ſtile:</l>
               <l>Wherefore I pray your Excellence,</l>
               <l>To hear me with great patience:</l>
               <l>Of ſtinking Weeds macular,</l>
               <l>No Man may wear a Roſe Chaplate.</l>
               <l>Soveraign, I mean of theſe ſide tails,</l>
               <l>Which through the duſt and dubs trails,</l>
               <l>Three quarters long behind their heels,</l>
               <l>Expreſs againſt all Common-weels:</l>
               <l>Though Biſhops in their Pontificals,</l>
               <l>Have Men to beare up their ſide tails,</l>
               <l>For Dignity of their Office:</l>
               <l>Right ſo a Queen or an Emprice,</l>
               <l>Albeit they uſe ſuch gravity,</l>
               <l>Conforming to their Majeſty,</l>
               <l>Though their Robes Royal be up-born.</l>
               <l>I think it but a very ſcorn,</l>
               <l>That every Lady of the Land,</l>
               <l>Should have her tail ſo ſide trailand;</l>
               <l>Albeit they be of high eſtat,</l>
               <l>The Queen they may not counterfeit:</l>
               <l>Where ever they go, it may be ſeen.</l>
               <l>How Church and Calſay they ſweep clean,</l>
               <l>The Images into the Kirk,</l>
               <l>May think of their ſide tails great irk:</l>
               <l>For when the Weather been moſt fair,</l>
               <l>The duſt flies higheſt in the Air</l>
               <l>And all their Faces doth begaire.</l>
               <l>If they could ſpeak, they would them wary.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To ſee I think a pleaſant ſight,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Italy</hi> the Ladies bright,</l>
               <l>In their Cloathing moſt triumphand,</l>
               <l>Above all other Chriſten Land:</l>
               <l>Yet when they travel through the Towns,</l>
               <l>Men ſees their Feet beneath their Gowns,</l>
               <l>Four Inches above their proper Heels,</l>
               <l>Circulat about as round as Wheels:</l>
               <l>Where through their doth no Powder riſe,</l>
               <l>Their fair white limbs for to ſurpriſe.</l>
               <l>But I think moſt abuſion.</l>
               <l>To ſee Men of Religion,</l>
               <l>To bear their tails through the Street,</l>
               <l>That Folks may behold their Feet:</l>
               <l>I trow Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Blaiſe,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Caus'd never Man beare up their Claiſe.</l>

               <l>Cauſ'd nere beare up their Tails I trow.</l>
               <l>But I laugh beſt to ſee a Nun,</l>
               <l>Cauſe bear her Tail above her Bun,</l>
               <l>For nothing elſe, as I ſuppoſe,</l>
               <l>But for to ſhow her lillie white Hoſe:</l>
               <l>In all their rules they will not find,</l>
               <l>Who ſhall bear up their Tails behind.</l>
               <l>But I have moſt into diſpite,</l>
               <l>Poor Clagocks clad with raploch white,</l>
               <l>Which have ſcarce two marks of fees,</l>
